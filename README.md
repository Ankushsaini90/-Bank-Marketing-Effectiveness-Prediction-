## Summary
One of the industries that is being transformed the most by the recent Machine learning advances is the finance industry. Be it predicting the stock prices, or in our case predicting, a customer willingness to subscribe to a term deposit. Therefore, in our project we have come up with a solution that increases the efficiency by making fewer calls but improves the success rate.

Our experiment can help understand what could be the reason for the classification of such labels by feature selection, data analysis and prediction with machine learning algorithms taking into account previous trends to determine the correct classification.
